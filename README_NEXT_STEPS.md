## Use `dev` Branch

yes, I built **all** the Phase 18 refactoring (Structure: `src/core`, `src/views`) on the `feature/ghost-mesh-live` branch.

This feature branch is **already merged into `dev`**.

The `research` branch you are currently on uses the **OLD** structure (`invisible_core`).
Trying to rebase or merge now will break everything by mixing old and new folders.

**ACTION:**
Please run:
`git checkout dev`

Then you will have the correct Phase 18 code.
